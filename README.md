# Web Dev Portfolio

Welcome to my Web Developer Portfolio. This is written in HTML, CSS & JS. This project I undertook in order to strengthen my understanding of code structure & use, and how to build a responsive layout. In the end, it ultimately became a sandbox for me to experiment & create in.

## Key Takeaways


**Code Structure & Application:** I paid very deliberate attention to how the code for this page was structured, why it was written a certain way, and the logic behind the decisions. This provided me perspective for how I would approach future projects.

**Responsive Design:** This project used media queries to approach how the page is displayed on varying screen sizes. A lot was gained by viewing how these attributes altered the appearance and layout of the page.

## If I Revisited This Project, 
#### I Would...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..replace some of the existing code with more semantic HTML. The number of div tags can be reduced by using more appropriate & descriptive tags.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..convert to CSS to SASS to improve the readability & modularity of the code, in addition to removing any redundancies in the naming conventions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..run the HTML & CSS through W3Câ€™s Validators to check for any syntactical errors.
